# Formspree Configuration
# Get your Formspree endpoint from https://formspree.io
# After creating a form, you'll get an endpoint like: https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID

# GitHub Pages Configuration (if deploying to project repository)
# If your site is at username.github.io/repository-name, set this:
# GITHUB_REPOSITORY=username/repository-name

# Note: For static export (GitHub Pages), API routes won't work.
# The contact form uses Formspree instead of the API route.
